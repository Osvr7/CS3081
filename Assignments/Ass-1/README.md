# CS3081 - Artificial Intelligence Assignment-1

## 1. Team Information
* **Osama Abutaha** - Student ID: S23108673
* **Yousef Jubili** - Student ID: S24108969

## 2. Implementation Approach
* **Code Analysis:** We analyzed the `tictactoe.py` template and internal comments to understand the required logic.
* **Logic Integration:** We translated game rules into Python code for state handling and winner detection.
* **Minimax Algorithm:** We implemented the Minimax algorithm to ensure optimal AI play.

## 3. Challenges & Solutions
* **Function Connectivity:** We used assignment hints and lecture slides to connect helper functions to the main loop.
* **The "Runner" Bug:** We discovered a critical line in `runner.py` was commented out; uncommenting it fixed the game initialization.

## 4. Alpha-Beta Pruning (Bonus)
* **Status:** Not implemented.
